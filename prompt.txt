Please summarize the following survey responses for me. The survey responses are left by students after completeing a homework assignment. 
The question the students are answering are " Please summarize the contents of this homework and detail any concepts or technical content you are still confused by. "
Place more emphasis on topics that come up repeatedly about any concepts or technical content that students are still confused by. 
The information should be presented in a way that is useful for a professor to look at and gain an understanding of where students need more help.
The survey responses are as follows. Individual responses are separated by three semicolons (;;;). If there are less than three responses, 
or there is not enough data to provide a good response, please say that and don't attempt to create your own repsponse/summary.
